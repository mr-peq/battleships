Battleship game in C

This is my 1st ever program. It runs on console.
I had learned C (which was my introduction to programming langages) a few weeks before writing it, so it is obviously VERY painful to read now.
It needs a lot of refactoring/rewriting.

My sincere apologies in advance to anyone who would venture in this maze...
It sucks, but it works !

PS: all comments, variables, function names etc... are written in French.
