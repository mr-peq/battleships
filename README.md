# Battleships
Battleship game in C, where a user can challenge an AI for ocean domination !

This is my 1st ever program. It runs on console.
I had learned C (which was my introduction to programming languages) a few weeks before writing it, so it is obviously a mess in some places.


### Planned next:

Big refactoring


### Note:

All comments, variables, function names etc... are written in French.
